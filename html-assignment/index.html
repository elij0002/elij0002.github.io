         <article>About Me</article>
        <p>My name is Madalyn Elijah-Porter. I am 19 years old, and have recently moved to Ottawa.
        I moved here a couple weeks ago from Brantford, Ontario. 
        I grew up in upstate New York or Buffalo countryside and also still live in the country back home. 
        So slowly I have been adjusting to city life here.</p>

        <p>I am the second eldest of my 3 siblings, I have an older sister and 2 younger brothers. 
        My dad is an accountant and my mom is a stay at home mom/wife. I also have a niece and nephew that I miss very much, 
        as it goes both ways. I facetime everyone as often as I can.</p>

        <p>My favorite food if I had to choose would have to be sushi or Indian tacos. 
        My favorite drink is either coffee or freshwater, city water tastes weird.</p>

        <p>I love being outdoors. I don't think I could choose one season as my favorite, as I love all 4 of them. 
            Although the fall/Halloween time is my favorite time of year, I love dressing up and seeing everyone 
            dressed in their costumes. As well, watching scary movies is always fun. </p>

        <p>In my free time I love to paint, watch movies or go for walks and listen to music. 
        I donâ€™t think I have a specific music taste, I really enjoy all kinds of music. 
        Just depends on my mood. This is a little bit about.</p>
